    "Going back to Notebook 1, the SFR supplementary catalog contains SFRs averaged over different timescales and within different apertures. You can add those to your galaxy catalog and follow the procedure above to find the main sequence slope. Then, you can explore the dependence of the slope on these choices. You can also check out the results in Donnari+ (2019): https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07584 or Pillepich+ (2019): https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05553."

    "## Exercise: categorizing galaxies into star burst, main sequence, green valley, and quenched\n",
    "\n",
    "The logSFR vs. logMs plane is often used to define different galaxy populations. These definitions usually categorize a galaxy as being a star burst, main sequence, green valley, or quench galaxy based on how far above or below the galaxy is from the main sequence ridge. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will classify galaxies based on the following definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. quenched: galSFR <= MS_SFR-1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. green valley: MS_SFR-0.5 >= galSFR > MS_SFR-1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "2. main sequence: MS_SFR+0.5 >= galSFR > MS_SFR-0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "3. star burst: galSFR > MS_SFR.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here, galSFR is the star formation of a galaxy (in dex) and MS_SFR is the corresponding value of the SFR along the main sequence ridge (in dex).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code block, you will define a function that takes in an arbitrary list of stellar masses and SFRs (each of length N) and outputs an array galClassification (length N) that classifies the galaxies into one of the above categories. That is, each galaxy will be assigned a number (either 0, 1, 2, or 3) based on its classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do this using the total stellar masses and the instantaneous star formation rates. Earlier, we determined the ridge of the line going through these data had a slope of 0.9059 and a y-intercept of -8.977."
